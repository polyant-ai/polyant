## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- First public open-source release of Polyant, with a Supervisor runtime for configurable AI assistants, automatic long-term memory, and multi-channel delivery.
- Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, webhooks, and an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API, alongside multi-instance administration and conversation inspection.
- Encrypted per-instance secrets, plugins and Markdown skills, Room automation, and runtime analytics.
- Bounded agent-to-agent handoffs, live activity, configurable web search, and structured tool-secret inputs.

### Changed

- Semantic Versioning now defines the public compatibility contract for the documented OpenAI-compatible API, Plugin SDK and manifest, and documented configuration and migration behavior.
- Conversation traces preserve per-step reasoning and tool metadata; incoming message fragments can safely cancel and restart an in-flight run.

### Fixed

- Memory deduplication now honors its configured similarity threshold, and Google OAuth remains optional when its credentials are absent.
- Delegated sub-agents cannot recursively spawn further sub-agents.
- Node.js 22 is aligned across the supported development and container environments.
